Welcome to my personal GitHub page!

I am currently a final year Ph.D. candidate at KTH Royal Insitute of Technology (Stockholm), under the supervision of Prof. Proutiere Alexandre, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at the Division of Decision and Control Systems.

My Ph.D. program involves the study of poisoning attacks on controlled dynamical systems, which includes:

 * Poisoning attacks on Sequential Decision Makers (Reinforcement Learning, Adaptive Control, Data-Driven Control)
 * Attack detectability
 * Statistical learning of attacks
