Welcome to my personal GitHub page!

I am a researcher in Reinforcement Learning and Control methodology. I have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from KTH Royal Insitute of Technology (Stockholm), where I was supervised by Prof. Proutiere Alexandre at the Division of Decision and Control Systems.

My research involves the study of Reinforcement Learning and data-driven control, including

 * Exploration in Reinforcement Learning
 * Reinforcement learning methodology
 * Conformal prediction
 * Learning in control
 * Poisoning attacks on Sequential Decision Makers (Reinforcement Learning, Adaptive Control, Data-Driven Control)
 * Attack detectability
